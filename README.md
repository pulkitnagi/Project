# Toxic Comment Classification Project
# Introduction
 This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify comments as toxic or non-toxic. Toxic comments often contain offensive, harmful, or inappropriate content, and it is essential to identify and moderate them to maintain a positive online environment.
# Project Overview
 In this project, we will build a machine learning model to automatically classify comments into two categories: toxic and non-toxic. This model can be useful for online platforms, social media, and discussion forums to filter out harmful or inappropriate content and improve the overall user experience.
# Dataset
 To train and evaluate our toxic comment classification model, we will use the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains a large number of Wikipedia comments that have been labeled as toxic or non-toxic.
# Prerequisites
 Must ensure you have met the following requirements:
1.Python 3.6+
2.Pip package manager
3.Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
# Usage
 Once you have set up the project, you can use it for various purposes, such as training, evaluating, and deploying the toxic comment classification model.
# Training
 To train the model, you will need to run the training script and specify the necessary parameters.
